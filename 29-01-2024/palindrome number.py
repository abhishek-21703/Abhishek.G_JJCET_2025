'''
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left

      return False

    rev = 0
    y = x

    while y:
      rev = rev * 10 + y % 10
      y //= 10

    return rev == x
